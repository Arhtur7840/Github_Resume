                <h2>Eifel Tower, Paris, France.</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most recognisable structures on the planet, the Eiffel Tower is an iconic landmark watching over the French capital. It was built by Gustave Eiffel for the 1889 Exposition Universelle, to celebrate the 100th year anniversary of the French Revolution. 
                    It’s a monumental sight from the ground (especially when lit up at night) but it also offers breathtaking panoramic views of the city from its observation decks. So unless you’re a little wobbly about heights, make sure you go up to the top.

                <h2>Taj Mahal, Agra, India.</h2>
                <p>
                    Built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in 1648 as a testament to love, this staggeringly beautiful white marble mausoleum is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
                    The Taj Mahal complex is an architectural marvel and an artistic masterpiece, with intricate details, symmetry and a scale that will make you gasp. In fact, it’s considered to be one of the most beautiful and accomplished examples of Indo-Islamic art and architecture found anywhere in the world.

                <h2>Machu Picchu, Peru.</h2>
                <p>
                    Nestled in the Andes Mountains, Machu Picchu is an ancient Inca city that was hidden for centuries before being discovered in 1911. Exploring the well-preserved ruins of this once-mighty citadel feels like stepping back in time, with the added bonus of breathtaking mountain vistas to marvel at.

                <h2>Great wall of China.</h2>
                <p>
                    Stretching an incredible 13,000 miles, the Great Wall of China is an awe-inspiring feat of engineering. Parts of it date back to the 7th century BC, although it was only finished in 1878.
                    Designed to protect China’s northern empire from attack, the wall is one of the longest man made structures on the planet. Walking along its ancient paths is quite the experience, although you’ll need to pack some sturdy walking shoes.

                <h2>Statue of Liberty, New York City, USA
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A truly iconic symbol of freedom, the Statue of Liberty stands tall over New York Harbor and welcomes visitors and new arrivals to the United States.
                    This colossal neoclassical sculpture was a gift from the people of France, made from several tonnes of copper (which now has a verdigris appearance due to oxidation over time). It was dedicated in 1886 and made a National Monument in 1924.
                    Once you’ve admired Lady Liberty from the ground, climb to her crown for incredible views of the city skyline.

                <h2>Colosseum, Rome, Italy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once a grand amphitheatre, the Colosseum is a testament to the power and engineering prowess of ancient Rome. As you explore its ruins in the heart of the modern city of Rome, where it has stood for nearly 2,000 years, you can imagine the gladiatorial battles that once took place in this infamous arena.

                <h2>Pyramids of Giza, Cairo, Egypt</h2>
                <p>
                    As the last remaining wonder of the ancient world, the Pyramids of Giza are a precious historical and architectural treasure. These monumental tombs, built as the final resting place for Ancient Egypt’s most powerful rulers, have stood for over 4,500 years.
                    You can look at photos, but there’s nothing like being there in person to appreciate the enormous size and mysterious power of the pyramids - while also learning about ancient Egyptian civilization.

                <h2>Sydney Opera House, Sydney, Australia</h2>
                <p>
                    A striking masterpiece of modern architecture, the Sydney Opera House is renowned for its unique sail-like design. It’s a feast for the eyes from outside, where you’ll need to see it from different angles to drink in every detail. But you can also step inside to catch a performance or take a guided tour of the interiors.
                    And while you’re there, check out Sydney Harbour Bridge. It’s an impressive piece of engineering and an iconic part of the harbour landscape - and you can even climb to the top for exhilarating experience and amazing views. If you have a head for heights, of course.

                <h2>Petra, Jordan</h2>
                <p>
                    Carved into vibrant red rock and surrounded by desert, the Lost City of Petra is an ancient city undiscovered by the Western World for centuries. This once thriving metropolis dates back to the fourth century BC, and now lies in (impressively preserved ruins).
                    Known as the ‘rose city’, this UNESCO World Heritage Site offers surprises and treasures at every turn, from intricate facades to secret passages. It’s one of the world’s most famous archaeological sites, and one of the new wonders of the world.

                <h2>Santorini, Greece</h2>
                <p>
                    There may be more vital, vibrant and interesting places to visit in Greece, but nowhere does the idealised picture-postcard paradise version of Hellenic island life quite like Santorini. If you’re only going to visit one Greek island, and you want definitive content for your Insta, Santorini has your back.
                    Wind through the historic narrow streets of Oia, hike uphill for views of the island’s famous blue and whitewashed houses and windmills, and watch a once-in-lifetime sunset over the island’s volcanic caldera - ideally from your own private plunge pool, with a glass of ouzo in your hand.
